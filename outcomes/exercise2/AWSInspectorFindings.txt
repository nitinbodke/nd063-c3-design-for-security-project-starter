1. Finding Instance i-08f86a32fe6e8c7ec is not compliant with rule 4.2.4 Ensure permissions on all logfiles are configured, 1.0.0 CIS Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS Benchmark. Applicable profiles: Level 1 - Server, Level 2 - Workstation, Level 2 - Server, Level 1 - Workstation.
Recommendation
Run the following command to set permissions on all existing log files: # chmod -R g-wx,o-rwx /var/log/*

2. Finding Instance i-08f86a32fe6e8c7ec is not compliant with rule 5.1.2 Ensure permissions on etccrontab are configured, 1.0.0 CIS Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS Benchmark. Applicable profiles: Level 1 - Server, Level 2 - Workstation, Level 2 - Server, Level 1 - Workstation.
Recommendation
Run the following commands to set ownership and permissions on /etc/crontab: # chown root:root /etc/crontab# chmod og-rwx /etc/crontab

3. Finding Instance i-08f86a32fe6e8c7ec is not compliant with rule 1.1.6 Ensure separate partition exists for vartmp, 1.0.0 CIS Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS Benchmark. Applicable profiles: Level 2 - Workstation, Level 2 - Server.
Recommendation:
For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/tmp . For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate. Impact: Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations.

4. Finding Instance i-08f86a32fe6e8c7ec is not compliant with rule 5.2.9 Ensure SSH PermitEmptyPasswords is disabled, 1.0.0 CIS Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS Benchmark. Applicable profiles: Level 1 - Server, Level 2 - Workstation, Level 2 - Server, Level 1 - Workstation.
Recommendation
Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: PermitEmptyPasswords no

Medium:
1. Finding Minimum length for passwords is not configured on instance i-08f86a32fe6e8c7ec in your assessment target.
Recommendation
If you are using passwords, it is recommended that you configure minimum length for passwords on all EC2 instances in your assessment target. Enforcing a minimum password length reduces the risk of a successful password guessing attack. To enforce minimum password lengths, set the “minlen” parameter of **pam_cracklib.so** in your PAM configuration. See man pam_cracklib for more information.

2. Finding No password complexity mechanism or restrictions are configured on instance i-08f86a32fe6e8c7ec in your assessment target. This allows users to set simple passwords, thereby increasing the chances of unauthorized users gaining access and misusing accounts.
Recommendation
If you are using passwords, it is recommended that you configure all EC2 instances in your assessment target to require a level of password complexity. You can do this by using **pam_cracklib.so** "lcredit", "ucredit", "dcredit", and "ocredit" settings. See man pam_cracklib for more information.

3. Finding Instance i-08f86a32fe6e8c7ec is configured to support password authentication over SSH. Password authentication is susceptible to brute-force attacks and should be disabled in favor of key-based authentication where possible.
Recommendation
It is recommended that you disable password authentication over SSH on your EC2 instances and enable support for key-based authentication instead. This significantly reduces the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack. For more information see [https://aws.amazon.com/articles/1233/](https://aws.amazon.com/articles/1233/). If password authentication is supported, it is important to restrict access to the SSH server to trusted IP addresses.
Solution for 1-3:
TODO
Apply strict password policy

4. Finding Instance i-08f86a32fe6e8c7ec is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. This increases the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack.
Recommendation
To reduce the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack, we recommend that you configure your EC2 instance to prevent root account logins over SSH. To disable SSH root account logins, set PermitRootLogin to 'no' in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and restart sshd. When logged in as a non-root user, you can use sudo to escalate privileges when necessary. If you want to allow public key authentication with a command associated with the key, you can set **PermitRootLogin** to 'forced-commands-only'.

Solution:
sg-06eb02d7ef76b3982 is too open.
Only port that needs to be open is 5000.
Remove all other open ports.
