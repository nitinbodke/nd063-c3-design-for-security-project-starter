Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Source: Architecture diagram
"Free Recipes" bucket is accessible from both WebAppSG and AttackInstanceSG
Solution:
Limit "Free Recipes" bucket access to WebAppSG

# Poor practice 2
Source: Architecture diagram
Instances in WebAppSG are accessible via internet.
Solution:
Limit WebAppSG access to AppLoadBalancerSG. Block all other access to WebAppSG.

# Poor practice 3
Source: Architecture diagram
Both buckets are accessed over the internet. So data leaves the VPC.
Solution:
Use VPC endpoints for buckets, so data limited withing VPC.

# Poor practice 4
Source: c3-app.yml
Instance role is not fine tuned.
Solution:
InstanceRole:
1. S3 actions should be fined tune:
    1. GetObject
2. Resource should be limited to S3BucketRecipesFree
i.e.
Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::S3BucketRecipesFree/*"
],

# Poor practice 5:
Source: c3-s3.yml
Data in buckets is not encrypted.
Solution:
Encrypt data at rest in S3

# Poor practice 6:
Source: c3-s3.yaml
AWS account id should is a part of bucket name.
Solution:
Use randomly generated number instead of AWS account number.

# Poor practice 7:
Source: c3-app.yaml
WebAppSG ingress configuration is too open.
Narrow down ingress. Remove fallowing.
      - IpProtocol: -1
        CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
      - IpProtocol: tcp
        FromPort: 22
        ToPort: 22
        CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
      - IpProtocol: tcp
        FromPort: 80
        ToPort: 80
        CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
Solution:
1. Remove all protocol access.
2. No need to open SSH port
3. As we are using 5000 to server traffic, drop port 80 from list.

# Poor practice 8:
Source: c3-app.yaml
key/pair ssh access is enabled for Web Service Instance.
Solution:
For SSH, use AWS System Manager Session Manager.
Move to immutable Web Service instance.

# Poor practice 9:
Source: c3-app.yaml
Application is accessible over http. Suspectible to Man-in-middle attack.
Solution:
Use HTTPS.
