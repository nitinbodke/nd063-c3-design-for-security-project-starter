# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Application components:
EC2: WebInstance
1. Limit egress to port 5000
2. Egress to S3?
2. Manage instance through AWS System Manager
    1. No exposure to internet is required
    2. No passwords/keys to manage
    3. Best is to no login at all i.e. immutable instance.
3. Can we move it to private subnet?
4. Use CIS hardened image
5. Keep instance upto date and patched
6. Add monitoring for vulnerabilities to ensure both os and apps vulnerabilities are addressed.
7. Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious events


Web application:
1. health check in LB
2. Static code scan
3. Dynamic code scan
4. APM
5. Rate limiting
6. Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious events
7. Caching via CloudFront
8. WAF to protect from attacks and exploits
    1. placed in front of public facing application services such as CloudFront  and API Gateway transparently
    2. Enable WAF monitoring and export logs
   2.Examples
        1. Akamai
     2. Cloudflare
     3. AWS WAF


AppLoadbalancer:
1. HTTPS
2. WAF
3. CloudFront

S3:
1. Enable versioning on buckets.
2. Enable MFA delete
3. Allow SSL request to retrive data from S3 i.e. encryption in flight
4. VPC endpoint for S3 so that data never leaves VPC
5. Restrict secret recipes bucket access to specific role.


Common Threat vectors:
1. OWASP 10
2. Pen Testing
3. Secret bucket access should be on different network
4. Monitoring and alerting at all layers:
    1. User activity
    2. Network traffic
    3. Cloud Configuration
5. Gaurd duty alerts
6. Use security monitoring with SIEM tool
    1. Splunk
    2. Sumologic
    3. Lacework
    4. CloudKnox

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
No, if IAM permissions are insecure, VPC private endpoints for S3 do not prevent the unauthorized access.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
Ref: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/s3-existing-objects-default-encryption/#:~:text=Enabling%20default%20encryption%20doesn't,applies%20only%20to%20future%20uploads.&text=Additionally%2C%20any%20objects%20already%20encrypted,remain%20encrypted%20with%20SSE%2DS3.
1. Enabling default encryption doesn't change the encryption of existing objects in bucket.
2. Encryption applies to future uploads.
3. To change the encryption of existing objects,
    1. You must re-upload the object
    2. Copy the object over itself.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
Applying original cloud formation templates will
1. Delete added resources.
2. Will revert modified resources to match the applied template.
