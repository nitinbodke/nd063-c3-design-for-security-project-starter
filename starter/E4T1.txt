# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
1. Update SSH config to remove password authentication on RecipeWebServiceInstance instance
2. Limit WebAppSG access to AppLoadBalancerSG. Block all other access to WebAppSG.
3. For SSH, use AWS System Manager Session Manager. Move to immutable Web Service instance.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
First attempt:
1. Create group.
2. Add all privileged users to this group.
3. Restrict S3BucketRecipesSecret access to this group only.
Above approach do not work.

Another attempt:
Ref: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-restrict-amazon-s3-bucket-access-to-a-specific-iam-role/
Ref: https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html
1. Use Role to restrict access to S3 bucket.
2. Only allow privileged users to assume this role.
